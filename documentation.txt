synchronous vs asynchronous:

synchronous theory in javascript: 
javascript's default behavour is synchronous javascript.javascript can run one statement at a time.

For example:
console.log("Line one");
console.log("Line two");
console.log("Line three");
Here,When run the code, "Line two" can not start before "Line one" is finished."Line three" can not start 
before "Line two" is finished.
we might heared javascript is single threaded language.

asynchronous theory in javascript:
Asynchronous controls How do we perform tasks which take time to complete for example getting data from 
database.
In asynchronous javascript,start something now and finish it later.

callback function
a function passed to another function as an argument is referred to as a callback function. The callback 
function runs after the completion of the outer function. It is useful to develop an asynchronous JavaScript 
code.
